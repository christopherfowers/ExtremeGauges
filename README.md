# ExtremeGauges
Intended to bring many types of gauges to angularjs in the form of easy to use directives. Despite the number of already existing radial gauge directives out there, I have noticed that there is a lack of open source solutions for other gauge types. I will be working to get this going as fast as possible for AngularJS ver. 1.X.X and eventually porting it over to Angular 2. Keep an eye on this project as I intend to update often. Please submit requests and bug reports through the github Issue Tracker for this project.

Should anyone wish to contribute, feel free to fork and create a pull request. 

# Installation #
I will be adding this library to bower in the future. For now, simply clone this repository and reference
/dist/extreme-gauges.js in your project. Then add the extreme-gauges to your angular project dependencies.

```html
<script src="components/ExtremeGauges/dist/extreme-gauges.js"></script>
```

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', ['extreme-gauges']
```
